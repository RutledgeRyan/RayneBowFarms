<h2>Who is RayneBow Farms LLC?</h2>
	<div id="LilliPic"></div>
	<h3>Lilliana (Lilli) Rayne</h3>
	<p> Daughter to both Ryan Rutledge and Ciera Burgess, I am the inspiration behind the brand <span class="Raynebow">RayneBow Greens</span class="Raynebow">! Though I was only born in 2022, I have a lot of influence
	in the decision-making of this "growing" company. I get to learn how to care for the microgreens with mom and dad and occasionally cohearse a couple pinches for a snack!</p>
	<div id="CieraPic"></div>
	<h3>Ciera Burgess</h3>
	<p>Mother to Lilli and owner/operator of <span class="Raynebow">RayneBow Farms LLC</span class="Raynebow">, she has set out on a mission to create locally grown, nutrient dense microgreens with the utmost importance on freshness and shelf-life. Ciera wishes to fight the issues her family and many other Hoosiers face each week of produce shipped from other states going bad within days of purchasing them at local stores. Her goal is to provide the Hamilton County community with nutrient dense microgreens that can be produced year round and delivered directly to your door. </p>
	<div id="RyanPic"></div>
	<h3>Ryan Rutledge</h3>
	<p>Father to Lilli and co-owner of <span class="Raynebow">RayneBow Farms LLC</span class="Raynebow">, he has a knack for growing absolutely superb microgreens through the process of germinating, concentrated lighting, climate control, and steady upkeep of the plants. Ryan has the vision to help as many people as he can with more nutritious options that will preserve for longer than most local grocery store products. His goal is to continue expanding the growing process and customer base for the microgreens to eventually be able to provide the service to local hospitals, schools, and other priority Indiana locations. </p>
